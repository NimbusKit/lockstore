/**
 * Typical use:
 *
@code
NSString* const kSomeKey = @"somekey"; // Defined externally, likely as an extern

NILockStore* lockStore = [NILockStore new];

@synchronized(lockStore[kSomeKey]) {
  // Read
  id someThreadSafeObject = lockStore[kSomeKey].object;

  // Write
  lockStore[kSomeKey].object = someNewThreadSafeObject;
}
@endcode
 *
 * How it Works
 * ------------
 *
 * An instance of NILockStore dispenses a NILockObject when accessed with `[]` notation.
 * The dispensed NILockObject instances are consistent between every access, allowing you to provide
 * the object to `@synchronized` in order to create an object-specific read/write lock.
 *
 * Once a lock has been acquired, you can safely read and write the NILockObject's
 * NILockObject::object at will.
 *
 * > Effort should be made to minimize the amount of time spent locking any given object.
